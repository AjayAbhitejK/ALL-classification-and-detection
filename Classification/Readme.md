This folder contains the training and testing scripts for the various classification models to classify ALL cells from healthy(or)normal cells.
The various DL models used are:
- VGG19
- Xception
- ResNet50
- EfficientNetB0
- EfficientNetB3

Here is the performance of the models:
| Model | Accuracy(train) | Accuracy(Test)	| Precision	| Recall	| F1-score |
| :---: | :-------------: | :------------:  | :-------: | :----:  | :------: |
|VGG19|50.0|49.1|49.1|49.1|49.1|
|EfficientNetB0|96.2|93.5|93.5|93.5|93.5|
|ResNet50|89.0|91.8|91.8|91.8|91.8|
|Xception|98.1|96.8|96.8|96.8|96.8|
|EfficientNetB3|97.4|95.6|95.6|95.6|95.6|
